contacts-iOSmode-android
=====================

This project was born for answering this stackoverflow [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26965095/how-do-i-override-swipe-animation-between-two-views-between-two-fragments-that-a). Implemented two **ViewPager** scrolling together, i.e. one ViewPager following another ViewPager's scrolling motions by some rules. As that question said, this effect just like an iOS contacts list. Consist of an alphabet and a contact list. Alphabet scroll **simultaneously** if the coming contact of contact list not longer belong to current alpha.

Describing maybe not very clear, just take a look at below illustration.
